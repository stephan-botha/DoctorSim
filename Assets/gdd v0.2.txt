DoctorSim – Game Design Document (v0.2)
A first-person comedic medical mastery simulator with dangling tools, tactile minigames, and hospital sandbox chaos.
________________________________________
1. High-Level Concept
DoctorSim is a first-person medical comedy simulator where the player—an overwhelmed new intern—roams a living hospital ecosystem responding to pager calls, diagnosing patients, performing tests and treatments via quirky tactile minigames, and gradually rising through the medical ranks.
Unlike traditional hospital management sims, DoctorSim is embodied and hands-on.
You walk the halls.
You push the wheelchairs.
You wield dangling tools that jiggle with every step.
You perform absurdly simplified medical procedures that somehow work.
The core fantasy:
Become a legendary doctor… by surviving your own incompetence.
________________________________________
2. Player Fantasy
The emotional arc is “Intern → Icon.”
Players start as a clueless day-one doctor armed with a trembling thermometer and raw enthusiasm. Through chaotic consults, clumsy tests, successful treatments, and comedic mastery of medical tools, they rise through:
Intern → Resident → Registrar → Consultant → Attending → Professor
By the end, they are the hospital’s mythic hero—summoned for bizarre medical mysteries, prestigious cases, and ridiculous “grand rounds.”
The tone is warm, silly, and uplifting—not grim or realistic.

4. Core Gameplay Overview
DoctorSim plays like a first-person “hospital town” game:
1.	Receive pager call
2.	Navigate the hospital (ED → Cardiology → Radiology → etc.)
3.	Interact with a patient
4.	Perform tests via tactile minigames
5.	Diagnosis made automatically (or manually in advanced rank)
6.	Administer treatments
7.	Discharge patient → earn money + XP
8.	Buy new equipment / unlock new tools
9.	Rank up → access new departments and complex cases
Movement, tools, minigames, and physical interactions are the heart of the experience.
________________________________________
5. Core Loop
1. Page → Go → Diagnose
Pager notifies you:
“Consult needed — Bed 3, chest tightness.”
You walk/run/wheelchair-drift there.
2. Perform Tests
Hover crosshair over patient → card shows required tests.
Select tool → press E → minigame begins.
3. Diagnosis
After all tests:
•	Diagnosis appears
•	Treatments unlock
•	Pager may give instructions if it’s urgent
4. Perform Treatments
Each treatment is its own tactile interaction.
5. Discharge & Reward
Patient thanks you (or gives side-eye).
You gain:
•	Money (for tools/equipment)
•	XP (for rank progression)
6. Progression
Unlock:
•	new departments
•	more complex diseases
•	advanced tools
•	prestige ranks
Repeat.
The loop is snack-sized and endlessly repeatable.

6. Movement & Controls
FPS Control Scheme
•	WASD: Move
•	Mouse: Look
•	E: Interact
•	1–5: Tool selection
•	Space: Confirm / special use
•	Shift: Sprint (slightly clumsy)
Wheelchair (Vehicle Mode)
•	Acquire wheelchair → player “holds” it as the equipped tool
•	Use it to transport patients to equipment stations
•	It controls like a lightweight, slightly drifty cart
________________________________________
7. The Dangling Tool System
The signature visual mechanic:
No hands. Only tools.
Tools float/hang in front of the camera with:
•	idle sway
•	bobbing when walking
•	comedic jiggle on collisions
•	wobble when misused
This creates tactile comedy and removes animation complexity.
Each tool has:
•	activation zone
•	minigame behavior
•	sound FX
•	success state
________________________________________
8. Minigame System
Minigames use three universal archetypes, allowing dozens of tools without reinventing the wheel.
A) Hold-in-Zone
Thermometer, Eye Light, Pulse-ox, Ultrasound probe
•	Keep tool inside wobbling zone
•	Timer fills
•	Patient reactions try to disrupt
B) Follow Shape / Rhythm
Stethoscope, EKG wand
•	Keep tool aligned with moving outline
•	Or press rhythmically in sync with heartbeat sounds
C) Timing / Charge-and-Release
Reflex hammer, sprays, IV injector, defibrillator
•	Time a click
•	Or charge and release at correct moment
•	Or multi-tap sequence
This framework is scalable for a solo dev.

9. Tools
Basic Tools (Intern – Resident)
•	Thermometer
•	Stethoscope
•	Reflex Hammer
•	Eye Light

Intermediate Tools (Registrar – Consultant)
•	Full EKG Wand
•	Advanced IV Injector
•	Nebulizer
•	Portable Ultrasound
•	Defib Paddles
Advanced Tools (Attending – Professor)
•	CT Scanner
•	MRI
•	Specialist ultrasound probes
•	Multi-step diagnostic kits
________________________________________
10. Patients
Patients are expressive caricatures with:
•	animate symptoms (shivering, coughing, wheezing, blinking)
•	humor reactions (“Is this part of the protocol?”)
•	vital bar (mild decay)
•	test card (shows tests → treatments)
•	mood (affects XP bonus)
They are never gory or realistic—always stylized.
________________________________________
11. Conditions (Diseases)
Conditions are data-driven cards requiring 1–4 steps.
Early:
Fever, flu, cold, sore throat, mild allergy, simple anxiety
Mid:
Chest discomfort, hypoxia, pneumonia-lite, palpitations, migraines
Late:
Complex arrhythmias, stroke mimics (stylized), neuro weirdness, rare VIP cases
Endgame:
Absurd fictional syndromes (“Infinite Hiccups”, “Wobble Fever”)
________________________________________
12. Hospital Environment (The “Town”)
A connected, walkable 3D hospital with:
•	ED (starting zone)
•	General Medicine
•	Short Stay / Observation
•	Cardiology
•	Radiology (CT/MRI)
•	Neurology
•	Advanced Diagnostics

________________________________________
A) Money
Earned per patient.

•	new tools
•	advanced equipment stations
•	department upgrades
•	cosmetic office items
________________________________________
